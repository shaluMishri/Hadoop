01/01/2016-2541555^1/1/2016^Card Opened In Error^per CH: I was offered the Sun Trust Credit card at the Safeway in Briggs Chaney Plaza on Outlet Drive after making a deposit yesterday Dec 28th 2015. I told the teller I did not want it but she kept insisting that I should take it and throw it away when it came. I told her that I did not need any more credit cards and I did not want it. Before I left I heard her say it would be my New Year gift but I told her before I left that I did not want it. She said her name was Sandra and I just want to make sure that she understood when I said no I do not want the card.^"Please know that I have closed this card.  In addition, I have filed a formal complaint in regards to this issue.  Please know that action will be taken to prevent issues like this from happening in the future.  Once again, I am truly sorry for this issue that occurred at the branch."^ ^Include^ANA
